# Tetrys â˜³ [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/morkro/tetrys.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/morkro/tetrys)
Tetris as Progressive Web Application _(currently still in active development)_.

## News :fire:
I am currently searching for a designer to partner me! Please get in touch with [me](https://github.com/morkro), if you're interested in collaboration.

## Development :wrench:
This application _requires_ Node.js `>=6.0.0` to run locally and the [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) for debugging Redux applications.

To get started, `npm install` all dependencies. To run the application in **development** mode, use the `npm run dev` command. A **production** build can be created with `npm run build`.

### Updating service worker version
The service worker version is tied to the `package.json` version. To bump the applications and service worker versions, use [`npm version`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) command:
```
npm version [ major | minor | patch ]
```

### Architecture
Tetrys uses [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) as state container, and no view library. The Sass architecture follows the [7-1 Pattern](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) from Sass-Guidelines.

## Tools, Resources and Credits :heart:
