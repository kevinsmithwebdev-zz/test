# redux_lite_todo
Tutorial: Simple Redux-like library for the use in your old codebase apps - and by old codebase apps I mean those apps that have one or couple of gigantic jQuery-powered files where you can't understand anything what's happening anymore.

This tutorial is a code example for the blog post I wrote here: https://viktorfonic.com/start-using-redux. Check it out!
